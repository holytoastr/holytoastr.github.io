            Uses Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and Devise to create a full-stack web-site that allows users to create persistent new content and comment on existing content.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this rails project, I approached it by working on a single model at a time. Once that model was completely built out and all errors had been eliminated, I added the next model. In this way, I could follow an error driven development path. Each error guided me to the next step in developing the app. In the future, I would like to implement a way to allow users to view more than one "emotion" at a time.

            <span class="portfolio-title">Memory Game: </span>
            Uses HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript to create an interactive web-hosted memory game.
          </p>
          <p>
            To approach this challenge, I broke the game down into its most basic component -- a card. The card had to have certain properties: It had to have a location on the board, it had to have a face, it had to have a back, and the user had to be able to flip the card over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I had a card, I could move on to the next component: a deck of cards. These again had their own properties. The face cards had to be created in sets of pairs. The deck had to be shuffled. Etc...
          </p>
          <p>
            Only after the entire deck was in place did I begin to add the game rules. There were some challenges I had to overcome in implementing these rules. Some of these were identifying which cards were clicked, remembering the values of the active clicked cards, and preventing the user from clicking matched cards

          <p>
            The purpose of this project was to take advantage of jQuery to create and manipulate the DOM. In the future, I would like to add some logic to allow the game to determine and announce a winner.

            A little bit about me.
            I recommend you don't fire until you're
            within 40,000 kilometers. Fate. It protects fools, little children,
             and ships named "Enterprise." I'm afraid I still don't understand,
              sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he
               can start dating his sister. I've had twelve years to think
               about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed
                the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. This is not
                about revenge. This is about justice. Damage report! Shields
                up! Rrrrred alert! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire
                phasers? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three
                primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant
                melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Fear
                is the true enemy, the only enemy.
