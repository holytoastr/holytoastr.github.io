            We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the
            assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Your shields were
            failing, sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his
            friend if he can start dating his sister. Mr. Worf, you do
            remember how to fire phasers? Why don't we just give everybody a
            promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Fate. It protects
            fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Travel time
            to the nearest starbase? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.
            But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of
            rolling a seven. A lot of things can change in twelve years,
            Admiral. Sorry, Data. I will obey your orders. I will serve this
            ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I
            will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty
            to Starfleet. That might've been one of the shortest assignments
            in the history of Starfleet. About four years. I got tired of
            hearing how young I looked. Well, that's certainly good to know.
            Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere
            competence. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian
            canapés? Are you up for promotion? Damage report! How long can two
            people talk about nothing? When has justice ever been as simple as
            a rule book? Computer, lights up! Captain, why are we out here
            chasing comets? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

            Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we
            know ourselves? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.
            Not if I weaken first. Damage report! Flair is what marks the
            difference between artistry and mere competence. You bet I'm
            agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Your
            shields were failing, sir. I guess it's better to be lucky than
            good. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
            Well, that's certainly good to know. Commander William Riker of the
            Starship Enterprise. Did you come here for something in particular
            or just general Riker-bashing? Computer, lights up! Fear is the true
            enemy, the only enemy. Congratulations - you just destroyed the
            Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Besides, you look good
            in a dress.
