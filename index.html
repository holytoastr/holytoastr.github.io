            We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the
            assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Your shields were
            failing, sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his
            friend if he can start dating his sister. Mr. Worf, you do
            remember how to fire phasers? Why don't we just give everybody a
            promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Fate. It protects
            fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Travel time
            to the nearest starbase? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.
            But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of
            rolling a seven. A lot of things can change in twelve years,
            Admiral. Sorry, Data. I will obey your orders. I will serve this
            ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I
            will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty
            to Starfleet. That might've been one of the shortest assignments
            in the history of Starfleet. About four years. I got tired of
            hearing how young I looked. Well, that's certainly good to know.
            Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere
            competence. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian
            canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Damage report! How long can two
            people talk about nothing? When has justice ever been as simple as
            a rule book? Computer, lights up! Captain, why are we out here
            chasing comets? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.

            Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we
            know ourselves? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.
            Not if I weaken first. Damage report! Flair is what marks the
            difference between artistry and mere competence. You bet I'm
            agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Your
            shields were failing, sir. I guess it's better to be lucky than
            good. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
            Well, that's certainly good to know. Commander William Riker of the
            Starship Enterprise. Did you come here for something in particular
            or just general Riker-bashing? Computer, lights up! Fear is the true
            enemy, the only enemy. Congratulations - you just destroyed the
            Enterprise. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Besides, you look good
            in a dress.

            A little bit about me. I recommend you don't fire until you're
            within 40,000 kilometers. Fate. It protects fools, little children,
             and ships named "Enterprise." I'm afraid I still don't understand,
              sir. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he
               can start dating his sister. I've had twelve years to think
               about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed
                the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. This is not
                about revenge. This is about justice. Damage report! Shields
                up! Rrrrred alert! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire
                phasers? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three
                primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant
                melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Fear
                is the true enemy, the only enemy.
